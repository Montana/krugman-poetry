# krugman-poetry
Python script I've made to make a poem I made about Paul Krugman interactive.

## Poem entitled "Paul Krugman" by Michael Mendy 

```bash
Economist
Sits at desk
Types numbers into spreadsheet
Frowns slightly
Thinks about global trade
Drinks coffee from mug with faded New York Times logo
Sighs
Opens X
Tweets about tariffs
Closes X
Stares out window
Wonders if anyone reads his columns anymore
Remembers he won Nobel Prize
Feels momentary satisfaction
Returns to spreadsheet
Cycle repeats
```
Sincerely, 
- Michael Mendy.
